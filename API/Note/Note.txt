- Each Angular application has to have at least one MODULE FILE that is DECORATED with the  @NgModule
=> when we see the symbol @NgModule => referred to as a decorator and we can supply (Cung cap) with some configuration options.
- Inside NG module we use DECLARATION any components that our module needs to load
- IMPORTS: if we want to use any modules from ANGULAR or our own modules => add imports

- Inside file main.ts this provide some JS code
- In angular.json File => contain a code that configuration Angular Application
- Package.json => details any dependencies this application has. (When we created our Angular application => all of these dependencies were download)
=> Those of dependencies contained inside the node_modules folder

- CORS: Browser security feature => prevent your browser from downloading nasty data from a server
- if don't use CORS => our client can download some dodgy code JS which executes a request to some dodgy API server and then send us back some nasty code then gets executed by our browserP
  => must add CORS based on Program.cs

- When to want add a font-awesome css => download by using npm install font-awesome => then add into the key "styles" of key "client" in file angular.json "./node_modules/font-awesome/css/font-awesome.min.css"
